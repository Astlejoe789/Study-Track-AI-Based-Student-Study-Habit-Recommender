#  Study-Track – AI-Based Student Study Habit Recommender

##  Project Overview

**Study-Track** is an AI-based system designed to analyze students' study habits and generate **personalized study recommendations**. The project uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to help students improve productivity, consistency, and academic performance.

---

##  Problem Statement

Students often struggle with:

* Poor time management
* Ineffective study routines
* Lack of personalized guidance

Traditional one-size-fits-all study plans are inefficient. This project addresses the problem by using **AI-driven analysis** to recommend customized study strategies based on individual student data.

---

##  Solution Approach

The system:

1. Collects student study-related data
2. Preprocesses and normalizes the data
3. Groups students using **clustering techniques**
4. Applies AI-based logic to generate **personalized study plans**
5. Outputs clear, actionable study recommendations
